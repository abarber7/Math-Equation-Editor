# About MathQuill

Learn how MathQuill works [here](http://docs.mathquill.com/en/latest/Contributing/#building-from-source). This is important to know for when we build our plugin.

### Example Source Code

[Basic Symbols](https://github.com/mathquill/mathquill/blob/master/src/commands/math/basicSymbols.js): the logic behind how symbols are handled.

[Math](https://github.com/mathquill/mathquill/blob/master/src/commands/math.js): determining cursor movements and operators

[Testing](https://github.com/mathquill/mathquill/blob/master/test/unit/html.test.js): we can structure our tests similar to theirs



**Note: These links help in the design process, our goal is to not actually re-implement what MathQuill has already done (for the time being).**
